<h2>Effect of Tools/Materials</h2>
<article>
<h3>Media for graphic communications</h3>
<p>Workable tools and materials are the media for graphic communications. Factors such as size, hardness, color, texture and durability can affect how the graphic form is presented. For example, large cave paintings allow the graphic to be a realistic depiction of things but a small painted stones requires a systematic mark-making limited in the size, which result in a more abstracted representation. And another example of the script on palm leaves, the forms become more rounded because straight lines tended to damage the leaves.</p> 
<p>The tools used on materials also depends on the material's physical properties. Materials such as clay, stone, papyrus, skin, bone, wax, metal and wood work best with specific tools to paint, engrave, carve, inscribe, or write. </p>

<h3>Cross-cultural Design</h3>
<p>Cross-cultural design commonalities and differences. The pictographs (picture directly represents the object) are usually similar in different cultures, though different materials available in each area lead to varying media and tools for graphics. When it becomes more abstract forms such as signs and symbols, the meaning could be different. </p>
<p>And the writing of a language requires the conceptual linkage of visual signs to a linguistic system, which depends on more than tools and media, but aligns to economic, political religious and social activities. </p>
